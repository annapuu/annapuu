# Hello! 👋🏼✨

I'm Anna Puck, a certified Data Analyst currently working as a project manager in database marketing. I'm a curious person with the desire to understand, a love of learning and an interest in anything visual.

At the end of 2023 I started learning to use Tableau by taking part in the bi-weekly data visualization community project "Back 2 Viz Basics". In January 2024, I finished the course "Introduction to Data Science & Machine Learning" by opencampus.sh, which gave me basic understanding in Data Science, Machine Learning and AI as well as more practical experience in using R and Python.


## Skills 🧑🏼‍💻
- German (native), English (fluent), Japanese (intermediate)
- Python, R, SQL, Excel
- Tableau (beginner to intermediate)


## Prior Experience 🧑🏼‍🎓
Before becoming a Data Analyst, I worked in project management at a small bureau that provides a network for creative people and creates websites and tools for cultural projects and institutions. Besides my main tasks that involved coordinating projects, testing new websites or tools, doing customer support and communication in general, I delved into the backend and worked with the database (MySQL), edited simple parts of the code of a website (e.g. changing a colour or hiding a button by date), worked with versioning (netbeans) and with website statistics (matomo).
Now, I work as a project manager in database marketing at a newspaper company. I am responsible for the planning and selection of lead/customer data for our e-mail and letter campaigns (salesforce, access). Other regular tasks include cleaning, preparing and importing data manually from external sources as well as analyzing specific subjects like our sources for lead generation or our customer retention activities.

I have a Master's degree in Art History and	Prehistoric & Historical Archaeology.
