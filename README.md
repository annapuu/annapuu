# Hello! 👋🏼✨

I'm Anna Puck, a recently certified Data Analyst currently looking for her first role in this field. I'm a curious person with the desire to understand and a love of learning.

Right now I am learning to use Tableau by regularly taking part in the bi-weekly data visualization community project "Back 2 Viz Basics". Just recently, I finished the course "Introduction to Data Science & Machine Learning" by opencampus.sh, which gave me basic understanding in Data Science, Machine Learning and AI as well as more practical experience in using R and Python.


## Skills 🧑🏼‍💻
- German (native), English (fluent), Japanese (intermediate)
- Python, R, SQL
- Tableau (beginner)


## Prior Experience 🧑🏼‍🎓
Before becoming a Data Analyst, I worked in project management at a small bureau that provides a network for creative people and creates websites and tools for cultural projects and institutions. Besides my main tasks that involved coordinating projects, testing new websites or tools, doing customer support and communication in general, I delved into the backend and worked with the database (MySQL), edited simple parts of the code of a website (e.g. changing a colour or hiding a button by date), worked with versioning (netbeans) and with website statistics (matomo).

I have a Master's degree in Art History and	Prehistoric & Historical Archaeology.
