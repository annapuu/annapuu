# Hello, I'm Anna Puck!

As a recently certified Data Analyst I'm currently looking for my first role in this field.
I'm a curious person with the desire to understand and a love of learning.

- talk to me in English or German, basic to intermediate Japanese works as well
- coding in Python, R and SQL
- currently doing my first steps with Tableau

Before becoming a Data Analyst, I worked in project management at a small bureau that operates a network for creative people and creates websites for cultural projects and institutions.
